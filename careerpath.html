                        <h3>My Career Plan Outline</h3>
                        <p>I aspire to hold leadership positions such as CEO, CPO, or CHRO in the financial or tech industry. Drawing inspiration from the CEO of Citigroup, who hold an MBA from Harvard, I am motivated to achieve my goals. My education at BYU, with its unique blend of secular and spiritual knowledge, has equipped me with the skills and perspective to excel in my field. With unwavering determination, I am committed to working hard, developing my skills, and making a meaningful impact in my chosen industry.</p>
                        <h3>My Professional Background in the field</h2>
                        <p>I hold an undergraduate degree in Business Management, specializing in HR, Economics, and Entrepreneurship, which has provided me with a strong foundation in the business industry. After graduating, I joined Amazon as an HR Generalist in the operations industry, where I supported Area and Operations managers by providing timely data to enhance workforce engagement and reduce attrition rates.

                            Inspired by two successful managers at Amazon who had gone through the MBA program at BYU, I decided to pursue this new venture to advance my career. With the support of my wife, I enrolled in the rigorous MBA program and will be graduating at the end of April, a milestone that I am extremely proud of.
                            
                            During the summer, I interned with Citibank as an HR Management Associate, assisting with their risk and management division. Through hard work and dedication, I was offered a full-time position with Citibank, joining their prestigious Management Rotation program, known for identifying and grooming future leaders within the company.
                            </p>
                            <h3>My Projected Impact and Contributions in this field</h2>
                        <p>To fulfill my ambition of becoming a CEO or CPO, I recognize the importance of building a robust business foundation in both the financial and tech industries. Equally crucial is honing my strategic thinking and vision, encompassing a people-first approach that prioritizes the company's vision and mission while nurturing and valuing its employees.</p>
                        <p>To achieve my ambition, I must first understand my "Why," as it provides the meaning and purpose behind my pursuit. Knowing my "Why" makes it easier to visualize my future and the person I aspire to be. Watch the video below to grasp the significance of discovering and aligning with your "Why."</p>
